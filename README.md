INTERACTIVE MAP FOR AN EFFICIENTE CASH FLOW CONTROL WHICH INCLUDES PENDING ACCOUNTS (PAYABLE ACCOUNTS), RECEIVABLE ACCOUNTS) 

Objectives: 
1.- We will create an efficient cash flow control. 
2.- It will display the remaining cash flow in order to show the liquidity of the business.  4.- The visualization purpose of the map will be to display where the customers and providers are located.

What we will have as a final product is a cash Flow tool for businesses, that will program your expenses according to the date so you will trace income and expenses for paying to employees and providers and it will make easier for managers to calculate which day is optimal for paying pending accounts without endangering cash flow for the financial control.

-	1.- Current Bank Balance Account.
-	2.- Accounts Receivable.
-	3.- Accounts Payable.
